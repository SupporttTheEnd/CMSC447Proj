  },
  {
    "question": "Do I need to create an account to use this application?",

  },
  {
    "question": "Can I pursue multiple majors or minors?",

  },
  {
    "question": "What do the red and green dots in the Credit Auditor mean?",

  },
  {
    "question": "What happens if I add too many or too few credits to a semester?",
    "answer": "The system will highlight semesters with invalid credit counts. Fall/Spring semesters need 12-19.5 credits (unless credit enforcement is disabled), Winter sessions are limited to 4.5 credits, and Summer sessions to 16 credits."
  },

  },
  {
    "question": "Why can't I drag a course into the Class Cart?",
