                <h3>Bar Chart - Credits by Year</h3>
                <p>The bar chart illustrates the total number of credits accumulated per academic year. Tracking your
                    credits each year is crucial for making sure you're on pace to graduate within your intended
                    timeline.</p>
                <p><strong>*30 credits per year is a good goal to aim for if you want to graduate in 4 years. This means
                        taking roughly 15 credits per semester if you are just doing spring and fall, ensuring
                        you stay on track while maintaining a balanced schedule.</strong></p>
